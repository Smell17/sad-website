Stuff we have to do as of 4/15/2019

1. Familiarize the code
2. Role System (there is already a role system in place, but a user can only have one role)
3. Switch function of roles
    Currently:
        a. Admin has all functions of system
        b. Teacher can only add grades
        c. There is a Parent Role (only for viewing grades)
            i. we can remove this or not show it as a role.
4. Front End Design of everything (uses Bootstrap)
5. ALL Character Traits (optional?)
6. User Registration and Login
