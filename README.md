To get the system to work:
1. Import all sql files from the db folder in phpmyadmin

Stuff we have to do as of 5/17/19

1. System is a bit messy (lots of tabs for CA)
2. Class Advisory should show all students of class and teacher
3. Sectioning is manual (one by one)
4. All teachers can update the grades of student (even if he/she isn't their teacher)
