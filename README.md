To get the system to work:
1. Import all sql files from the db folder in phpmyadmin
    File location of db: C:\xampp\htdocs\grading\system\db

Stuff we have to do as of 5/17/19

1. System is a bit messy (lots of tabs for Class Advisor)
2. Class Advisory should show all students of class advisor (currently shows all students only)
3. View class list for Subject Teacher - This function is for subject teacher. It will show a list of all students for each class assigned. Once clicked on a specific name, it will show the final quarterly grades just for that subject. 
4. Sectioning is manual (you can only add one student to section per click of button.)
5. All teachers can update the grades of student in a class (even if he/she isn't their subject teacher)
6. Admin cannot view sections (with student's list)


MEDIUM PRIORITY (will have to add some sort of time and date function)

1. Set deadline for submission of grades
        -Admin sets a deadline for the subject teachers to input final grades of student.
2. Notify subject teacher about deadline submission
        -Notifies the subject teacher if distribution of report cards is near or if teacher has not inputted any scores for the student in a period of time
